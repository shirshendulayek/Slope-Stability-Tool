# Slope Stability Tool
The current web page context contains information about a tool that is built using HTML and CSS. The tool takes geometric and geotechnical parameters as inputs to predict the Factor of Safety (FOS) for these parameters. In Fig. 5 of the current web page context, the developed tool can be seen as it is taking the density, cohesion, frictional angel, dump height and dump angel as inputs and calculates FOS using trained model. This tool can operate locally as CPanel (host the static website developed) is used
