# Slope Stability Tool
The GUI is built using HTML and CSS. It takes geometric and geotechnical parameters as inputs to predict the FOS for these parameters. In Fig. 5 the developed tool can be seen as it is taking the density, cohesion, frictional angel, dump height and dump angel as inputs and calculates FOS using trained model. This tool can operate locally as CPanel (host the static website developed) is used. The link for the built tool is available at: https://rb.gy/wrmgz
